# CourseraML
Exercises from [Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning), but in Python!

Find all these [course videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRJdqdXieSHN0udSvZ-4kwX_Naqs4QJ19), as this maybe easier for some to watch on their TV etc
